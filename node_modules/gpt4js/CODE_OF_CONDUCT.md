# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on the work rather than on people
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or flaming
- Discriminatory jokes and language
- Sharing sexually explicit or violent material
- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of conduct. We will:

- Explicitly define our code of conduct and prominently display it
- Encourage members to report unacceptable behavior to an appropriate representative of the community
- Acknowledge and address concerns promptly and fairly
- Enforce our code of conduct fairly and consistently
- Provide a safe and welcoming environment for all

## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from members of the project community will not be tolerated. Depending on the severity of the behavior, community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the project and/or community.

Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to an appropriate representative of the community. You can find contact information for community leaders in the project's governance documents or on the project website.
